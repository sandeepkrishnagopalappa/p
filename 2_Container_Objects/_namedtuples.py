from collections import namedtuple

"""
1. Two parameters are required to create a named tuple: 
a class name and a list of field names, which can be given as an 
iterable of strings or as a single space- delimited string.
2. Data must be passed as positional arguments to the constructor
 (in contrast, the tuple constructor takes a single iterable).
3. You can access the fields by name or position.
4. They use less memory than a regular object because they donâ€™t store 
    attributes in a per-instance __dict__.
