'''
1. A Generator is a function that returns an iterator. It generates values using the 'yield' keyword.
2. They don't take memory of a list. They are LAZY Iterables. Generators are used for saving memory.
3. when called on next() function a raises StopIteration exception when there are no more values to generate.
4. 'yield' keyword suspends or pauses the execution of the function. But 'return' statement ends the function.
